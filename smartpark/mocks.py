    TODO: 
    - make your own module, or rename this one. Yours won't be a mock-up, so "mocks" is a bad name here.
    - Read your configuration from a file. 
    - Write entries to a log file when something happens.
    - The "display" should update instantly when something happens
    - Make a "Car" class to contain information about cars:
        * License plate number. You can use this as an identifier
        * Entry time
        * Exit time
    - The manager class should record all activity. This includes:
        * Cars arriving
        * Cars departing
        * Temperature measurements.
    - The manager class should provide informtaion to potential customers:
        * The current time (optional)
        * The number of bays available
        * The current temperature
